###001 Building a web page from scratch

----

You must build a web page from scratch that's all about you. Use this opportunity to tell us a little bit about yourself. What music do you like? Are you a career changer, or just starting out? What do you want to be doing in five years? What causes motivate you?

Another good option is to take your resume, and develop it in a web page!

**Requirements**

    Draw a quick sketch/wireframe of your web page. Iterate on this if necessary until you have a design you like
    Plan the structure of the page. What HTML elements are semantic for the page that you're trying to build? How do elements need to nest within each other?
    Build it! (:

**Your page should contain:**

    An image
    At least two paragraphs of text
    A bulleted list
    A link to another page (e.g., to social media, to random interest, etc)
    A link to a style sheet of vanilla CSS (no bootstrap)
        Please use flexbox for complex alignment. Bonus points for using CSS Grid.
    A copyright in a <footer> element that shows current year using Javascript

**What to Turn In**

Please turn in a picture of your planning documents, as well as a zip file OR github repository with your code in it. We'll be looking for clean, well-formatted HTML and CSS, good file structure, and semantic HTML.
